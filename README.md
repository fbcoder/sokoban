# Sokoban
This is just a clone of the popular crate pushing game sokoban.

## Controls
Arrow keys to move

## Browser
Mainly tested in Firefox, but I intend to support multiple browsers. Sometimes I also test with Chromium.

## TODO
* Respond to arrow keys in webkit.
* Align interface, different fonts and colors.
* More levels.

## Ideas
* Move all interface elements inside the canvas object (as this).

## Credits
The levels are taken from the game gsoko that is part of the Ubuntu repositories.

## Instructions
Just download the repo and open sokoban.html in a browser.
